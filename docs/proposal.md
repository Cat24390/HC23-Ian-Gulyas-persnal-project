## Random Lance Generator for BattleTech

<p>his desktop app will randomly generate a list of Units according to parameters set by the user for the wargame battle 
tech. Battle tech is not a very competitively oriented war-game. Instead battle tech is typically played rather casually or as 
part of narrative campaigns or RPG's. As such a means to randomly generate a force is useful as it allows for combat encounters to be easily created
or to facilitate novel scenario that those involved would not have considered. 
</p>

### Main Features
<p>There is only one main feature and that is of course the random generation of list. this randomisation
will be governed by a few factors such as: Specified Faction, Time period, and battle value. in addition
since it is a desktop app it doesn't need wifi which stands in contrast to the competitors. i would also
like to have a very clean, simple and user friendly interface. I intend to write this desk-top app in java, and make the GUI
using Swift. As for Librais I intend to use the list of mechs and information about them from MegaMek (a virtual simulation of table top
Battle Tech) it has a free use licence so I should be free to go on that front.  </p>

### Alternate Solutions 
<p> J. Campbel's random-force [1] Is a webapp that has most of the feature I want mine to have, with some issues: it has very 
few options for time period,and is is rather unintuitive to use. meaning that while I can use to generate a force, 
I never feel that I know why it is making that list in particular.
</p>

<p> BTforce [2] is another webb app that has options for two variants of Battletech but lacks any way to specify a time
period and is lacking most of the factions. it is however easier to use than [1]</p>


<p> Master Unit List's Force builder [3] is not a separate web app and is just a part of a much larger website, 
the random mech generation it offers has no customisation of any sort nor dose it conform to a preset battle value limit. As such it serves as more of a 
way to present option that a player might not have thought of as opposed to generate a list on its own. </p>

<p>Random Assignment tables (R.A.T'S) [4] These are a feature of Battletech source books that allow the reader to use dice to randomly generate a force for various 
factions. R.A.T'S have the downsides of being a physical solution, requiring you to buy a book, and having a limited degree of randomness (as they use 2 D6's).</p>

<p>  Keith "Xotl" Hann's Faction Assignment & Rarity Tables [5] These are a fan-made alternative to the RAT's the aim to increase the accuracy and the degrees of randomness. It being
a fan-made project it is completely free and available online as a pdf. with the only downsides being those innate to it by being a manual solution.  </p>
